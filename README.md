# Telco Customer Churn & Segmentation

## Project Overview
This project analyzes telecom customer data to predict churn and segment customers using both supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques.

## Dataset
Source: UCI / Kaggle – Telco Customer Churn  
File: Telco-Customer-Churn.csv  
Records Used: 1000 (sampled for fast experimentation)

## Objectives
- Predict customer churn using Random Forest classification
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy and ROC concepts
- Segment customers using KMeans clustering
- Understand customer behavior through visual analysis

## Machine Learning Techniques
- Supervised Learning: Random Forest Classifier
- Unsupervised Learning: KMeans Clustering

## Visualizations
- Churn confusion matrix
- Customer segmentation scatter plot (Tenure vs Monthly Charges)
- Feature importance analysis

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## How to Run
1. Install required libraries:
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
